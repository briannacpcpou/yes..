        Helloooo Jas, I just wanted to apologize to you for not being thoughtful enough. Firstly, I had two cookies with me yet I ate both of it without even thinking about you. I should've given you the other one. 
        Peroo I didn't want to disturb you man gud because you seemed so focused on what you were doing. Second, please don't get mad at Alessi for choosing to go with her classmates to Gaisano instead of with us. 
        You should ask her why she went with them. I hope you're doing well, Jas! We miss you. I'm sorry for not being a good friend and for not checking up on you pud. :(
      </p>
