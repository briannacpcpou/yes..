        Helloo Jas, I just want to properly apologize to you for not being a good friend, for being rude and disrespectful as well. I know you're probably upset because of three things or more. We'll never know, right? But anyway.. First, that ONE girl has been spreading rumors about you again. Second, Alessi bought me two cookies yet I was being inconsiderate and not being thoughtful enough to even give you one. Third or and the last one, you told me inside the classroom that you hate Alessi because she chose to go with her classmates to Gaisano instead of us. Well, I can't say anything about that, so just ask her. Anyway, Jas, I hope you reply to us na. We miss you na rabaa. She didn't mean to hurt your feelings, neither did I. I hope you're okay, Jas. I hope you'll finally reply to our messages. :(
