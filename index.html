      <h2>My Letter</h2>
      <p>
        Helloo Jas, I just want to properly apologize to you for not being a good friend, 
        for being rude and disrespectful as well. I know you’re probably upset because 
        of three things or more. We’ll never know, right? But anyway..
        <br><br>
        First, that ONE girl has been spreading rumors about you again. 
        Second, Alessi bought me two cookies yet I was inconsiderate and didn’t share. 
        Third, you told me you hated Alessi because she went to Gaisano instead of with us. 
        <br><br>
        Anyway Jas, I hope you reply to us na. We miss you! Neither of us meant to hurt your 
        feelings. I hope you’re okay and that you’ll reply to our messages soon. :(
          
        <br><br>
